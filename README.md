# Bounce-Revamped

I worked in a team of five and recreated the classic brick phone bounce game on the unity engine. The engine uses Visual Studio by default and we wrote the game in C#.

To run the game on your machine, follow the steps:

1. Download **Unity Hub** from [here](https://unity3d.com/)
2. After installation, download the GameJam2018-master as a zip file.
3. Build and run the game and enjoy! :)
